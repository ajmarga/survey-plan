# Target population

*General public 18 years old and older.*

Surveys on health and fitness devices should prioritize individuals aged 18 and above because adults are usually the target users of these devices, given their responsibility for personal health guidance.  Adults are more likely to be concerned about their health conditions which makes them more susceptible to this device. By focusing on the adult population, surveys can gather more relevant and reliable survey responses.

## Eligibility requirement:

Ownership of health or activity tracker:

**Do you own a fitness/health tracker device? I.e. apple watch, fitbit, samsung watch, whoop** 



>Considering if a participant owns a fitness/health tracker device this will allow us to access if the participant belongs to our intended demographic market. With that information, we will know whether or not they have the purchasing power to buy a similar product. 
Since this survey is targeting the general public, no specific strategy will be used to reach our target audience.

# Welcome

Thank you for participating in our survey! We are a team dedicated to improving health and fitness tracking technologies, and your input will help us better understand the features and preferences that matter most to users like you. This survey aims to gather insights on your experiences with fitness trackers and how we can enhance them to meet your needs. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping future innovations, and we appreciate your time and honest responses!

## About Fitness Trackers

Fitness trackers are wearable devices that allow people to monitor and track activities and information related to fitness, such as weight loss and sweat analysis, stress, sleep and real-time nutrients monitoring. These devices can be stand-alone or integrated within a smartwatch. Typically, they connect to a mobile app, enabling users to manage information and utilize app features.

### A Brief History

*Mid-1960s:* The first functional fitness tracker was invented.

*2012:* The first Fitbit was released.

*2014:* The first Apple Watch was revealed.

Your experiences and insights are critical to the continuous improvement of these devices, and weâ€™re excited to hear from you!
